# System for detecting objects on a prohibited line

## About this project

It is a project about participating in the Seoul IoT Hackathon 2018.

In South Korea, there are lines where placing things is prohibited for safety reasons in underground shopping malls or factories. Because, for example, a firewall may not work properly in the event of a fire. This project is a system that detects whether an object is placed on such a prohibition line and notifies the  administrator through LoRa. This system can also measure fine dust concentration, gas, and motion information.
